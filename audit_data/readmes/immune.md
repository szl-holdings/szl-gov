# IMMUNE — Verifiable AI you can't fake

A self-contained deployment of the IMMUNE investor demo: a single Node process that
serves the static UI **and** the real IMMUNE API (`/api/immune/*`) — the append-only
SHA-256 receipt chain, the SENTRA admission gate, the HUKLLA tripwires, and the
live/reference threat-intelligence feeds (Sigstore Rekor, MITRE ATLAS, OWASP LLM Top 10).

Nothing here is faked. Receipts, hashes, and the chain verifier run for real; every
externally-sourced datum carries an honest provenance label (LIVE / REFERENCE /
UNAVAILABLE).

## License

The IMMUNE source and this Space deployment definition are licensed under
[Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/szl-holdings/immune/blob/main/LICENSE).
Third-party data and standards retain their respective upstream terms and are
attributed by the application; the Apache-2.0 declaration does not relicense
external content.

## What's in the image

- `immune-server.js` — minimal Express server (immune router + SPA host), all Node
  dependencies inlined by esbuild (no `npm install` at image build time).
- `public/` — the vite-built static frontend.
- `data/immune/` — the **real** append-only receipt + evidence chain, seeded at build.

The server mounts only the immune router at `/api/immune` (no Bingle/Mulé/auth/DB) and
falls back to `index.html` for all non-API routes (SPA). It listens on `PORT` (default
`7860`).

## Build the artifact

From the repository root:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
SOURCE_REVISION="$(git rev-parse HEAD)" pnpm run build
```

This cross-platform build:

1. builds the static frontend with `BASE_PATH=/` into `dist/public`;
2. bundles `server/immune-standalone.ts` into a single `dist/immune-server.js`;
3. copies the static frontend and the real receipt chain into `dist/`.

## Run it locally

```bash
( cd frontend/deploy/dist && PORT=7878 node immune-server.js )
```

Verify:

```bash
curl -s localhost:7878/api/immune/state          # authoritative evidence state + receipt heads
curl -s localhost:7878/api/immune/ledger/verify  # 200, ok:true over the real chain
curl -s localhost:7878/readyz                     # exact hashes + read/write readiness and blockers
curl -s localhost:7878/                           # the static demo UI
```

## Build & run the Docker image

The build context is **this `deploy/` directory**, and `dist/` must already exist
(run `build-standalone.sh` first):

```bash
SOURCE_REVISION="$(git rev-parse HEAD)" pnpm run build
cd frontend/deploy
docker build -t immune-demo .
docker run --rm -p 7860:7860 immune-demo
```

Then open `http://localhost:7860` and query
`http://localhost:7860/api/immune/state`.

## Hugging Face Space (Docker SDK)

Push the contents of this `deploy/` directory (the `Dockerfile`, this `README.md`, and
the built `dist/`) to a Docker Space. The metadata header above (`sdk: docker`,
`app_port: 7860`) tells the Space how to build and expose the container. The ledger data
directory is made writable for the Space's non-root user so the chain can keep appending.
