# a11oy

This repository is the **source** for the product origin
[https://a-11-oy.com](https://a-11-oy.com).
Proof lives at [https://a11oy.net](https://a11oy.net).

`a11oy.com` is not a surface of this project.

a11oy is a governed-AI Command Center: deny-by-default policy, trust
ceiling 0.97, and a signed receipt for every decision. This tree is
that system's source. It is not the proof registry.

## Invariant

**receipts.in ≡ receipts.out**

A governed action is admitted only as a signed receipt and leaves only
as that same signed receipt. The two sides are identical. A mismatch
is a failed verification, not a display error.

## The proof backbone

The trust math behind a11oy is pinned in **Lean 4** and checked by a proof machine:

- **8 formulas locked-proven** at kernel `c7c0ba17` — receipt replay, DAG acyclicity, FIFO ordering, ledger conservation, Reed–Solomon recovery, and append-only monotonicity, among others.
- **Λ unconditional uniqueness = Conjecture 1** — machine-checked false (we found a counterexample). Conditional uniqueness is proven axiom-free (Theorem U). We say both out loud.
- **SLSA L1 honest · L2 build-attested · L3 roadmap**. No FedRAMP or ATO claimed.

### Persistent receipt storage (HF Space)

The protected deployment workflow attaches the existing
`SZLHOLDINGS/szl-evidence` Storage Bucket read-write at `/data`, preserving any
other attached volumes and failing closed if another volume already claims that
mount. The Series-A database is namespaced at:

```
A11OY_SERIES_A_DB=/data/a11oy/series-a/control-plane.sqlite3
```

Production also sets `A11OY_REQUIRE_PERSISTENT_STORAGE=1`,
`A11OY_SERIES_A_REQUIRE_MOUNT=/data`, and the network-filesystem-safe SQLite
rollback journal. If the bucket is detached or the database path escapes the
mount, Series-A registration fails closed instead of falling back to `/tmp`.
The unified Khipu and energy ledgers use separate `/data/a11oy/*` paths.

**Required HF Space secrets for full signing integrity:**
- `SZL_COSIGN_PRIVATE_PEM` — canonical ECDSA P-256 private PEM shared by all
  receipt surfaces. The deployment sets `A11OY_REQUIRE_PERSISTENT_SIGNING=1`,
  so an absent or malformed key disables signing instead of minting a
  replacement identity.

Check current signing and storage status at `GET /api/a11oy/v1/signing-status`
and `GET /api/a11oy/v1/series-a/status`.

## Honest status

| Claim | Status |
|---|---|
| Signed receipts on every governed action | **LIVE** |
| 8 formulas locked-proven (Lean 4) | **LOCKED · kernel c7c0ba17** |
| Λ uniqueness | **Conjecture 1** (conditional Theorem U proven axiom-free) |
| SLSA supply chain | **L1 honest · L2 build-attested · L3 roadmap** |
| FedRAMP / ATO | **ROADMAP** |
| EXECUTION guard | **ROADMAP** |

## Shared modules (must not drift)

`a11oy_agent_loop.py`, `a11oy_mcp_client.py`, and `operator_shell_v4.py` are **SHARED
byte-identical** with the sibling [killinchu](https://github.com/szl-holdings/killinchu)
deployment and must not drift. An in-repo ratchet pins their SHA-256 in
`.shared_module_hashes.json`; the `Shared-module hash lock` workflow fails if any of
them changes without the lock being regenerated. When a change is intentional,
regenerate the lock in the same PR and mirror the edit to killinchu (cross-repo
enforcement is a follow-up):

```
python3 .github/shared-module-hash-check.py --update
```

## Governed Delta Workspace

> Runtime write status is configuration-bound. GDW reports `REAL` only when its
> secret-managed credential registry, canonical governance gates, verified
> persistent storage, exact schema, and a fresh generation-bound supervised
> outbox pass are ready.
> Otherwise it reports `UNAVAILABLE` and writes fail closed.
>
> The public deployment remains `UNAVAILABLE` until this corrective source is
> protected-merged, exact-source relocked, and the production credential and
> persistence contracts are observed live. Source tests are not deployment
> evidence.

> GDW Frontier Push Pack is a MODELED instrumentation and verification extension for the Governed Delta Workspace. It provides load testing, operator validation, hybrid scheduling research hooks, KDA-vs-MLA memory benchmarking, and Lean-oriented proof export. It does not claim frontier benchmark superiority, proprietary activation access, or production-scale guarantees beyond the measured harness outputs.

The authenticated runtime, Postman collection, load tools, offline dashboard,
memory benchmark, proof-input bridge, and fail-closed readiness conditions are documented in
[`docs/gdw-frontier.md`](docs/gdw-frontier.md). A checked theorem is reported
separately from an exported theorem input, and every throughput result is scoped
to its captured run.
